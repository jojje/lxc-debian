It shouldn't take more than five seconds to create a VM or managing their
life-cycle states.

* lxc-debian creates a Linux Container VM in under five seconds after the
             initial run, where debian needs to download and cache the
             apt packages. This is an updated and enhanced version of the
             scripts that accompanies the debian LXC package, and includes
             fixes as well as some enhancements, esp. regarding networking.

* lxc-ctl    is a interactive control script which gives you a menu of your
             available containers, so you can simply mark the one you want
             to start or stop.
